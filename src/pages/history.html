      The sport of cricket has a known history beginning in the late 16th century. Having originated in south-east
      England, it became an established sport in the country in the 18th century and developed globally in the 19th and
      20th centuries. International matches have been played since the 19th-century and formal Test cricket matches are
      considered to date from 1877. Cricket is the world's second most popular spectator sport after association
      football (soccer).[citation needed]

      Internationally, cricket is governed by the International Cricket Council (ICC) which has over one hundred
      countries and territories in membership although only twelve currently play Test cricket.

      <div class="history_section">
        The British brought cricket to India in the early 1700s, with the first documented instance of cricket being
        played is in 1721. It was played and adopted by Kolis of Gujarat because they were sea pirates and outlaws who
        always loot the british ships so East India Company tried to manage the Kolis in cricket and been successful
        <br>


        <div class="points">
          <p><span class="bold">•1800s to 1918-</span>The first ever match of first-class cricket played in India was in
            1864 between Madras and Calcutta. Not many records exist from the match.


            Ranjitsinhji was regarded as one of the best batsmen of his time.
            The entire history of cricket in India and the sub-continent as a whole is based on the existence and
            development of the British Raj via the East India Company.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="points">
          <p><span class="bold">•1918 to 1945-</span>India became a member of the 'elite club' joining Australia,
            England, South Africa, New Zealand and the West Indies in June 1932. India's first match in Lord's against
            England attracted a massive crowd of 24,000 people as well as the King of the United Kingdom.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="points">
          <p><span class="bold">•1945 to 1960-</span>The major and defining event in the history of Indian cricket
            during this period was the Partition of India following full independence from the British Raj in 1947.

            An early casualty of change was the Bombay Quadrangular tournament, which had been a focal point of Indian
            cricket for over 50 years. The new India had no place for teams based on ethnic origin. As a result, the
            Ranji Trophy came into its own as the national championship. The last Bombay Pentangular, as it had become,
            was won by the Hindus in 1945–46.

            India also recorded its first Test victory in 1952, beating England by an innings in Madras</p>
        </div>
        <div class="points">
          <p><span class="bold">•1960 to 1970-</span>One team totally dominated Indian cricket in the 1960s. As part of
            14 consecutive victories in the Ranji Trophy from 1958–59 to 1972–73, Bombay won the title in all ten
            seasons of the period under review. Among its players were Farokh Engineer, Dilip Sardesai, Bapu Nadkarni,
            Ramakant Desai, Baloo Gupte, Ashok Mankad and Ajit Wadekar.

            In the 1961–1962 season, the Duleep Trophy was inaugurated as a zonal competition. It was named after
            Ranji's nephew, Kumar Shri Duleepsinhji (1905–59). With Bombay in its catchment, it is not surprising that
            the West Zone won six of the first nine titles.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="points">
          <p><span class="bold">•1970 to 1985-</span>Bombay continued to dominate Indian domestic cricket, with only
            Karnataka, Delhi, and a few other teams able to mount any kind of challenge during this period.

            India enjoyed two international highlights. In 1971, they won a Test series in England for the first time
            ever, surprisingly defeating Ray Illingworth's Ashes winners. In 1983, again in England, India were surprise
            winners of the 1983 Cricket World Cup under the captaincy of Kapil Dev.

            During the 1970s, the Indian cricket team began to see success overseas beating New Zealand, and holding
            Australia, South Africa and England to a draw. The backbone of the team were the Indian spin quartet –
            Bishen Bedi, E. A. S. Prasanna, BS Chandrasekhar and Srinivas Venkataraghavan, giving rise to what would
            later be called the Golden Era of Indian cricket history. This decade also saw the emergence of two of
            India's best ever batsmen, Sunil Gavaskar and Gundappa Vishwanath responsible for the back-to-back series
            wins in 1971 in the West Indies and in England, under the captaincy of Ajit Wadekar.
            The Indian women's team made its test debut in 1976, becoming the third nation to do so. It made its ODI
            debut on 1st January 1978.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="points">
          <p><span class="bold">•1985 to 2000-</span>From the 1993–94 season, the Duleep Trophy was converted from a
            knockout competition to a league format.

            Several team names and spellings were altered during the 1990s when traditional Indian names were introduced
            to replace those that were associated with the British Raj. Most notably, Bombay became Mumbai and the
            famous venue of Calcutta became Kolkata, both where the main places where the British did all their
            business.

            During the 1980s, India developed a more attack-focused batting line-up with talented batsmen such as
            Mohammad Azharuddin, Dilip Vengsarkar and Ravi Shastri prominent during this decade. Despite India's victory
            in the Cricket World Cup in 1983, the team performed poorly in the Test arena, including 28 consecutive Test
            matches without a victory. However, India won the Asia Cup in 1984 and won the World Championship of Cricket
            in Australia in 1985. The 1987 Cricket World Cup was held in India..</p>

          <p><span class="bold">•21st century-</span>Sachin Tendulkar was one of the key members during 1989–2013 for
            Team India in multiple formats.

            Since 2000, the Indian team underwent major improvements with the appointment of John Wright, India's first
            ever foreign coach. This appointment met success internationally as India maintained their unbeaten home
            record against Australia in Test series after defeating them in 2001 and won the inaugural ICC World
            Twenty20 in 2007. India was also the first sub-continental team to win at the WACA in January 2008 against
            Australia.[9]

            India's victory against the Australians in 2001 marked the beginning of a dream era for the team under the
            captainship of Sourav Ganguly, winning Test matches in Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka, West Indies and England. India
            also shared a joint victory with Sri Lanka in the ICC Champions Trophy, and went on to the finals in the
            2003 Cricket World Cup only to be beaten by Australia.[9]

            In September 2007, India won the first ever Twenty20 World Cup held in South Africa, beating their
            arch-rivals Pakistan by 5 runs in a thrilling final.[10]

            India won the Cricket World Cup in 2011 under the captainship of Mahendra Singh Dhoni,[8] the first time
            since 1983 (28 years) – they beat Sri Lanka in the final held in Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium.[11]

            India played its 500th Test match against New Zealand led by Kane Williamson at Kanpur from 22 - 26
            September 2016.[12] India won this match by 197 runs. This test was played under the captaincy of Virat
            Kohli.

            Currently, they are first in the 2019-21 ICC World Test Championship with 490 points and a PCT (percentage
            of points) of 71.They will play their final test in the 2019-21 ICC World Test Championship (which is also
            the final test in the 2021 Anthony De Mello Trophy) They played in their first series of the 2020-22 ICC
            Cricket World Cup Super League against the Australia national cricket team winning only one match and being
            fined 1 point for a slow over rate having only 9 points and being seventh in the league.
