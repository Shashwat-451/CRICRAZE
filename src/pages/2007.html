            The 2007 ICC World Twenty20 was the inaugural Twenty20 International cricket world championship, contested in South Africa from 11 to 24 September 2007. India won the tournament, beating Pakistan in the final.

            <div class="history_section">
                To say that nobody gave India a chance to win the inaugural T20 worldcup with that inexperienced side would be a serious understatement.

                <br>


                <div class="points">
                    <p>MS Dhoni-led India's journey to the T20 World Cup crown in the inaugural edition of the World T20
                        in 2007 in South Africa was nothing less than a fairytale. A relatively inexperienced India
                        team, led by a young but dynamic Dhoni were not even counted among the contenders to enter the
                        semi-finals, leaving aside the trophy.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="points">
                    <p>However, against all odds, the young Indian team made its way into the last four riding on their
                        most famous wins over the likes of South Africa and England. And after beating hot favourites
                        Australia in the semis, the Men in Blue entered the summit clash with a belief they could
                        achieve something special and leave behind the poor performance in the 50-over World Cup where
                        they exited in the group stage in the West Indies.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="points">
                    <p>In the final, India opted to bat first after winning the toss. India lost its first two wickets
                        with just 40 runs on the board. Gambhir was the one who kept on scoring regular boundaries to
                        keep the scoreboard ticking. Yuvraj Singh, the hero from the semi-final match against Australia,
                        found the going tough and he was dismissed for just 14 runs and skipper MS Dhoni also departed
                        cheaply for just six runs.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="points">
                    <p>Rohit Sharma, in the end, played a cameo of 30 runs to take the team's total to 157/5 in the
                        allotted twenty overs.

                        Pakistan's innings failed to get any type of momentum and the side was reduced to 77/6 in the
                        12th over. </p>
                </div>

                <div class="points">
                    <p>Misbah-ul-Haq then decided to take the matter into his own hands and he started dispatching
                        Indian bowlers all around the park and the Green Shirts were the clear favourites in the final
                        over as they needed just 13 runs.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="points">
                    <p>Dhoni decided to give the final over to Joginder Sharma. Misbah had dispatched the second ball of
                        the final over for a six and Pakistan were just 6 runs away from the target. India outclassed
                        Pakistan by 5 runs in the final of the inaugural T20 World Cup in Johannesburg on September 24
                        to lift the title for the first time 13 years ago.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="points">
                    <p>Fourteen years have passed since that memorable day and Team India is still in search of their
                        second World T20 title.</p>
