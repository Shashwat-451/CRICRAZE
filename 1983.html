            <h3 class="title">Cricket's greatest underdog story</h3>

            <div class="history_section">
                To say that nobody gave India a chance to even be at Lord's on the day of the final, never mind actually
                lifting the trophy on the famous balcony, would be a serious understatement.

                <br>


                <div class="points">
                    <p>In fact, some of the Indian players had looked at the World Cup in England as an opportunity for
                        sightseeing. "India were nowhere in contention," wrote Sandeep Patil, part of that triumphant
                        side, in 2015. "The team had hardly performed well in the previous two editions. So as we left
                        India, virtually all of us were in a holiday mood. Cricket was not the first thing on our minds.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="points">
                    <p>More than thinking about facing Malcolm Marshall, Bob Willis and Jeff Thomson, we were engrossed
                        in planning our sightseeing activities. After getting to London, we were excited to see
                        Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park and Trafalgar Square."
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="points">
                    <p>Their record coming into the third edition of the Cricket World Cup was far from envious – India
                        had won just one match, against East Africa, out of six in the first two editions.

                        Their record that year before the commencement of the World Cup wasn't great either, with a
                        solitary win in four games against Pakistan and West Indies.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="points">
                    <p>Despite the numbers being against them, India made a brilliant start to the tournament with a win
                        over favourites West Indies in their first game. Yashpal Sharma's 89 helped India to 262 in 60
                        overs. In response, West Indies were bundled out for 228, with Ravi Shastri and Roger Binny
                        picking three wickets each.

                        That was not the only upset on the day; at Trent Bridge in Nottingham, Zimbabwe, playing their
                        first-ever World Cup match, defeated Australia, thus giving India a little more hope of going
                        past the group stage. </p>
                </div>

                <div class="points">
                    <p>India made it two wins out of two by defeating Zimbabwe in their next game. Led by Madan Lal's
                        3/27 and Syed Kirmani's brilliant work with the gloves where he took five catches, India
                        restricted Zimbabwe to 155 before a 79-run partnership between Mohinder Amarnath and Sandeep
                        Patil guided them to victory.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="points">
                    <p>For a team that was not expected to make it to the semi-finals, India suddenly found themselves
                        at the top of their group. That, perhaps, brought in some complacency and it showed in the two
                        subsequent matches where they were humbled by Australia and West Indies.

                        Australia posted a daunting target of 321 for India to chase down, thanks to a sensational
                        century from Trevor Chappell, who was well supported by half-centurions Kim Hughes and Graham
                        Yallop. India crumbled under the pressure of the total as they were skittled out for just 158.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="points">
                    <p>India then ran into a West Indies side that had started to build up steam after their loss in
                        their tournament opener.

                        Playing their second round-robin match against India, West Indies posted 282/9 on the back of
                        Viv Richards' 119. India never recovered from the early strikes and only managed to get to 216,
                        with only four players getting to double figures. Mohinder Amarnath fought a lone battle with an
                        innings of 80 but found little support at the other end.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="points">
                    <p>The biggest travesty was that only the people in attendance at the Nevill Ground in Tunbridge
                        Wells got an opportunity to witness history before their eyes as the match was not televised at
                        the time.

                        Kevin Curran's 73 did threaten to take the game away from India but Kapil's men managed to hold
                        their nerve, living to fight another day with a 31-run win..</p>
                </div>

                <div class="points">
                    <p>His innings rubbed off on the rest of his teammates and breathed a new lease of life into India's
                        campaign. The effects were evident in their next game against Australia, which again was a
                        virtual knockout.

                        There were no standout players with the bat, but all the batters chipped in with valuable
                        contributions en-route India's 247. The pace trio Madan Lal, Roger Binny and Balwinder Sandhu
                        were too hot to handle for Australia, who were all out for 129. India, against all odds, booked
                        a berth in the semi-finals against England.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="points">
                    <p>The home side, having cruised to the semi-finals having lost just one of their six matches, were
                        difficult opponents. England were cruising along after opting to bat before Amarnath was called
                        upon by his skipper to put the brakes on. He stifled the batters with his medium pace and even
                        got the invaluable scalps of David Gower, the highest run-scorer in the 1983 World Cup, and Mike
                        Gatting.

                        His spell derailed all the momentum and England, who were 141/3 at one point, were bowled out
                        for 213. The Indian openers Sunil Gavaskar and Kris Srikkanth then provided the team with a
                        solid foundation, putting on 46 for the opening wicket.

                        Amarnath, having already worked his magic with the ball, made a difference with a bat as well
                        with an innings of 46. Half-centuries from Yashpal Sharma and Sandeep Patil got India across the
                        line with more than five overs to spare as India booked a date with West Indies for the third
                        time in the tournament – this time in the finals.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="points">
                    <p>West Indies were the odds-on favourite to win the trophy for the third time in a row. What stood
                        in their way was an Indian team that was scripting history with every step they took in the
                        tournament.

                        On a green track, having been put to bat first against the bowling line-up comprising Andy
                        Roberts, Joel Garner, Michael Holding and Malcolm Marshall, there weren't many ways India's
                        innings could have gone. They were bundled out for a meagre 183, with Srikkanth top-scoring with
                        38.

                        Kapil, however, refused to give up. During the innings break, he said: "Team, if this is not a
                        winning total, then it’s definitely a fighting total.”</p>
                </div>

                <div class="points">
                    <p>India needed early wickets to stay in the game and Sandhu answered his captain's call, dismissing
                        Gordon Greenidge for 1. The wicket brought the dangerous Viv Richards to the crease, and it
                        didn't take him too long to stamp his authority on the game.

                        India looked all at sea as Richards took the game away from them as he smashed seven boundaries,
                        including three in an over off Madan Lal. India's faint World Cup hopes started to dwindle.

                        Despite being taken to the cleaners by Richard, Madan Lal snatched the ball from his skipper for
                        one more over, as Kapil later narrated. "The best part about that dismissal was Madan Lal's urge
                        to bowl that particular over," Kapil later recounted. "Madan Lal literally snatched the ball
                        from my hands and went on to bowl that over. When someone has so much confidence, you give in."

                        It took a moment of sheer individual brilliance on the field to dismiss Richards, and the way he
                        was batting, it definitely needed something spectacular from India to see his back.

                        Richards mistimed a pull shot and Kapil, who was at mid-wicket, ran backwards to take a stunning
                        catch at deep square to dismiss the West Indies talisman.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="points">
                    <p>Lady Luck soon shone for India as skipper Clive Lloyd injured his hamstring off the very first
                        ball of his innings. His struggle too came to an end as he was dismissed in tame fashion for 8.

                        West Indies found themselves in unfamiliar territory at 66/5 and the one person who had shown
                        how to bounce back from such a situation was captaining the opposition side.

                        Jeff Dujon's 43-run stand with Marshall only delayed the inevitable as Amarnath cleaned up the
                        tail – India beat the mighty West Indies by 43 runs to script history at Lord's.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="points">
                    <p>Amarnath, who was the Player of the Match in the semi-final, was awarded the Player of the Match
                        in the finals, and still remains the only player to achieve that feat apart from Sri Lanka's
                        Aravinda De Silva in 1996.

                        The trophy was much more than just silverware for India. The visuals of Kapil Dev hoisting the
                        World Cup trophy in the Lord's balcony inspired the next generation of cricketers, like Rahul
                        Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar, and dared them to dream.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="points">
                    <p>After the final, West Indies captain Clive Lloyd said, "Indian cricket has arrived. And it's here
                        to stay."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="points">
                    <p>Those words have proven to be prophetic. </p>
